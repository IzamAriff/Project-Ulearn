# Project info
We see many student have problems with finding academic
info such as class times, courses, pointer and much more.
This project is made for students to review their academic
related info online with ease. The program has a bunch of class
such as a student class, lecturer, semester, result, course,
session, schedule and more. Also it has a database that stores
the necessary info about the user.
